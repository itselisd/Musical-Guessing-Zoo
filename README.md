# Welcome to the Musical Guessing Zoo!

* Play the game where all animals have names that start with the letter of the musical note they love the most.
* You will see three animals at a time and guess which chord the first letters of their names make.
* Watch out for the sharks in our zoo though!
* If you see a great white baring its teeth under an animal that means its note is sharp(#).
* If there is a hammerhead swimming underneath, its note is flat(b).
